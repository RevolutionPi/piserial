<summary>We have moved to GitLab! Read this for more information.</summary>

We have recently moved our repositories to GitLab. You can find piserial
here: https://gitlab.com/revolutionpi/piserial  
All repositories on GitHub will stay up-to-date by being synchronised from
GitLab.

We still maintain a presence on GitHub but our work happens over at GitLab. If
you want to contribute to any of our projects we would prefer this contribution
to happen on GitLab, but we also still accept contributions on GitHub if you
prefer that.
